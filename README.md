Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher Cracker Maybe
=====

maybe.

You can find generators online to play with this. These two scripts are supposed to help you crack an encrypted piece of text, supposedly, by doing frequency analysis. You run lettercounter.py on a file called test and then it will spit out statistics about the various letters. You can then fill out the dictionary in translator.py which will go through the test file and write out a file called output.txt that has the cipher translated with the values you put into the dictionary in translator.py

It's janky I'm a terrible programmer, but this might be a useful tool for CTF. Maybe.
